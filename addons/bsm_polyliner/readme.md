[h3] What is Polyline? [/h3]
The polyline mod allows you to save drawings on the map as code to load at the mission start... so you don't have to draw all the lines during the briefing thus saving load time and increasing the fun time.

Boost local FPS by hiding all non-important terrain objects that are located outside of the cover map module.
